Arduino
=======

Note that this repository is not ready for use. It should still be in active development.

Libraries
=========

* HIDGeneric - this implements pieces of the HID spec independent of the transport that carries it to the host
* RN42       - this implements the bluetooth transport in a way that is compatible with HIDGeneric
* USB_HID    - this provides a bridge between HIDGeneric and a native USB port (note that not all Arduino boards can use this) (not yet implemented)
